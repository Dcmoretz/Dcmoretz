# Hi, I'm Daniel Moretz 👋

**Cybersecurity Professional | Aberdeen, NC**  
CompTIA A+ · CompTIA Network+ · WGU B.S. Cybersecurity (2027)

## 🛡️ What I Do

I build and break things — legally. My focus is hands-on offensive and defensive security: deploying vulnerable environments, attacking them, then hardening them. I document everything so others can learn from it too.

Currently working as an **Enterprise Cybersecurity Champion at Fidelity Investments**, where I bridge the gap between security engineering teams and business units — translating complex threats into clear, actionable guidance.
